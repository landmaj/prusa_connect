This integration allows you to get current state of your printer via Prusa Connect API.
It should be mostly compatible with the official 
[OctoPrint integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/octoprint/)
allowing you to use existing custom cards, for example 
[threedy](https://github.com/dangreco/threedy).

If a custom card or something else intended for OctoPrint does not work, please report 
it as a bug.
